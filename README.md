## Introduction

Welcome to our Decentralized Crowdfunding Platform built on the Ethereum network. With this DApp, you can create campaigns and crowdfund your projects with cryptocurrency donations. The front-end is developed using React.js with the help of Thirdweb and Vite, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience. Connect your Metamask wallet to the application for secure transactions.

## Getting Started

Create a project using this example:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --template vite-javascript-starter
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/main.jsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

On `src/index.jsx`, you'll find our `ThirdwebProvider` wrapping your app,
this is necessary for our [hooks](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react) and
[UI Components](https://portal.thirdweb.com/ui-components) to work.

### Deploy to IPFS

Deploy a copy of your application to IPFS using the following command:

```bash
yarn deploy
```


## How to Use

1. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Connect your Metamask wallet to the application to enable secure transactions.

3. Create your crowdfunding campaigns and start raising funds for your projects using cryptocurrency donations.

4. To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The development server will automatically reload the application whenever you make changes to the code, allowing you to have a smooth development experience. 

## Technologies Used

- Ethereum Network: For secure and transparent crowdfunding transactions.
- React.js: For a user-friendly and interactive front-end experience.
- Thirdweb and Vite: Enhancing the development process for a seamless user interface.

## Credits

Inspired by the work of "javascript mastery" i've built upon their ideas to create this crowdfunding platform.
